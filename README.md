# LWJGL-First-person-camera-demo
![Screenshot of program](/lwjgl-camera-first-person/src/images/readme_image.png)
A simple first-person free-look camera. Made in Java with OpenGL through LWJGL. The program uses quaternions rather than Euler angles so as to avoid bizarre movement when attempting to look directly up or down.

Controls:
- W/S - Forward/Backward
- A/D - Strafe left/right
- Mouse movement - Look around
- Mouse scroll wheel - Change zoom level
